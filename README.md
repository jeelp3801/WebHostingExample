#### Project Overview
UMI is designed to support high school students with effective time management and focus. Inspired by the challenges students face when transitioning into high school, this app integrates AI-based learning features to help students stay organized, manage tasks, and foster healthy study habits.

### Key Features

- **Task Management with Notion**  
  Integrates with the Notion API to support adding, editing, and deleting tasks, making it easy for students to organize and prioritize their responsibilities. In addition, users are able to sync their tasks to Google Calendar to access your tasks on different platforms.

- **Personalized Music Suggestions with Spotify**  
  Provides user login and authentication through Spotify. UMI can access user data, track the currently playing status, and suggest songs based on genre or other criteria, helping students to maintain focus during study sessions. In addition, Umi provides a Pomodoro Timer with music for study sessions and brain breaks powered by your music.
